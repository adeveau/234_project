Background:
    BAMCP is about tree search in bayes adaptive MDPs, has a nice summary of what BAMDPs are. 
    POMCP is about tree search in POMDPs. Not 100% sure it's relevant for us, but it might be.
    mcrave and cRAVE are about improvements to MCTS

UCTtoCNN is about using UCT runs in Atari as training data for a CNN. Does better than DQN.
MCTS_ContinuousActionSpace is about using execution uncertainty to generalize across actions in the tree. Assumes the dynamics are known, though.
Haven't read the rest.
